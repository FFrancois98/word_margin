One of the most important deities in Egyptian mythology is the God Ra. To his people, Ra was considered the giver of life. He brought warmth and light to all those on earth, and each evening would battle his eternal enemy- a snake, who tried to swallow Ra and his creations. Most importantly, though, it was believed that Ra’s peoples, including all other deities, with their different powers, were merely different aspects of his being/different representations of him. 

When it comes to you Amber, you bring sunlight and positivity with you everywhere you go- especially to your teammates. You are always supportive and protective of them. As a captain, you lead your team, and we see that they are a reflection of your leadership. Because of these qualities you possess, we believe that you are an extension of Ra and his qualities and that why we have decided to bestow upon you the name of Ra’s Blueprint.
